# seattle-Airbnb-Open-data 2016
Data Visualization using Tableau
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used airbnb to travel in more unique, personalised way. As a part of the Airbnb inside intitative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA
The following Airbnb activity is included in this seattle dataset:
1. Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
2. reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
3. Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day
DESCRIPTION:
I created five visualisations and combined them to created a dashboard to answer few questions
1. Calculated the price for Airbnb based on their postcode/zipcode(this will help to analyse which location is very expensie and which location is less expensive and used bar chart with colours to differentiate the location)
2. Calculate the price by zipcode using latitude and longitude which is generated automatically. Used Maps to identify the price and compare it with the first visualization to match their results
3. Calculate revenue generated by Airbnb with respect to each month. Thie helps to identify which month generates greater revenue.(only year 2016)
4. Calculate average price per Airbnb based on the number of bedrooms under each categories.
5. Calculate the number of Airbnb's under each categories( like "a" number of airbnb with 1 bedroom, "b" number of airbnb with 2 bedrooms,etc)
